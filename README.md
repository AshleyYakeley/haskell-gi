# hlabyrinth

The is a simple labyrinth game in Haskell. It started as a project to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), but
it turned out to be written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

The original Rust implementation can still be found [here](https://github.com/cohomology/rustirinth), but is much less 
complete.
