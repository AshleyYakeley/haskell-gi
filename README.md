# hlabyrinth

## Rationale

The is a simple labyrinth builder "game" for my son, written in Haskell and using GTK+ and Cairo. It started as a project to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), but it turned out to be written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

The original Rust implementation can still be found [here](https://github.com/cohomology/rustirinth), but is much less 
complete.

## Game principle

It is possible to build a labyrinth, to place and start and end points and compute the shortest way through the labyrinth.
